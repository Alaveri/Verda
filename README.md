# Verda
Verda is a DOS text-based UI framework for Turbo/Borland Pascal 7.  Verda uses text modes rendered via graphics using any available SVGA resolution.  For example, while 80x25 text mode uses 640x480 VGA graphics, 800x600 would provide a 100x37 text mode.  

Verda is still under development, but will provide many available text-based UI controls, including menus, text editors, drop down lists, scrollbars, buttons, dialog boxes, trees, and more.  Since Verda is rendered in SVGA mode, it is possible to combine text and graphics at the same time, using any available drawing tools provided by the ADL's SVgaDriver unit.  Graphics modes require VGA or VESA-compliant SVGA graphics and provide auto-detection of available graphics and text modes.  Verda is being built using Turbo Pasal 7 and Visual Studio Code, using DOSBox emulating an S3 SVGA card.

Verda is currently being coded by a single developer from scratch as of April 2022 and is planned to have the most common functionality within the next several months.  If you are interested in contributing to the project, contact Sarah Shelby at sshelby@alaveri.org.
